Hyperfast Book Template is a self-contained template that helps you initialize your Jupyter-Book project inside the template. It is hyperfast in the sense that the template itself is converted into a Python project in the blink of an eye. It is also hyperfast in the sense that it helps you jump start your project with the best practices in the Python community.
